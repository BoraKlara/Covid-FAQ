        <h3 class="faq-title">What is Covid-19?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
          WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a
          report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s
          Republic of China.

        <h3 class="faq-title">What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          CAmong those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the
          disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously
          ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive
          care. Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure,
          acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock,
          thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the
          heart, liver or kidneys.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Yes. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December
          2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a
          daily basis here. At least 13 different vaccines (across 4 platforms)
          have been administered. Campaigns have started in 206 economies.

      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-title">How long does it take to develop symptoms?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin
          is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why
          people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at
          home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the
          spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.
